# Telecom_Domain_Analysis_PowerBI_Dashboard
Created a PowerBI dashboard for Telecom Domain Analysis

1. Project Task/Requirement - 

    AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers. However, the management noticed a       decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. Atliqoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report     of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable         them to make informed decisions.

    a. Importing the dataset into PowerBI.
    
    b. Cleaning/Reshaping the data using PowerQuery Editor.
    
    c. Data Modelling is used to create relationship among fact and dimension tables using Model Tab in PowerBI.

    g. Some new plans/offers should be put up in low performance cities to increase the revenue.
    
    h. Plans like p4, p5 which are performing low should be considered for modification to provide maximum usage of this plan by users.
    
    g. This dashboard also helps to track the plan that is responsible for drop in revenue between any particular month. This can be used to alter the plan and gain          maximum profit out of it.
